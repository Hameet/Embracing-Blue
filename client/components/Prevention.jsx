                    Suicide is the leading cause of death for Australians aged between 15 and 44, with around 3,000 people dying by suicide every year. That's an average of eight people every day.1 For every suicide, there are tragic ripple effects for friends, families, colleagues and the broader community.
                    If someone you know seems to be struggling, reach out and connect with them. Showing that you care could make a huge difference. If you find that you are struggling, it might feel better to reach out for support, talk to someone and make some positive changes, rather than doing it alone.
